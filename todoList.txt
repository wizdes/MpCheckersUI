3) Fix the sprite placements (side as well as edge calculation)
3.5) Fix the sprite highlight for red and white

4) Next part, when clicking on a placement, move the piece, and erase the placement.
5) make sure this works for both sides.

5) Then comes jumping.

1) draw the border
2) draw the checker pieces
3) add input logic 
3.5) Create an MVC model 
4) add a logical representation for "image with this space" and a "clicked here callback"
5) extend this logical representation for each board piece as well
6) create the two game states (User_CheckerPiece_Input, User_BoardPiece_Input)
7) reject click here callback logic if it's not in the right state
8) apply the right image move if the BoardPiece_Input was properly done
9) E2E test with all checker pieces
